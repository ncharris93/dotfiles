# Ensure the build will work

read all instructions before starting.

## Commands

In the following order, run these commands from the root of the project:

1. "pnpm run type-check",
2. "pnpm run lint",
3. "pnpm run test"

## Instruction Loop

If there is an error with one, stop immediately. Fix any errors.

Only after the errors have been fixed, run all the commands sequentially from the top. Do this until there are no errors in any of the steps.
